	Welcome to tonights debate where we will answer the question of if Excel is the better spreadsheeting software over Google Sheets.  Dave will be taking the side of Excel where Tristan will take the side of Google Sheets.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:46:11] User (Moderator):
	The first question of the night is this, Which spreadsheet software has better data tools for large extractions of data and to be able to transform that data effectively and simpily?
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:46:28] Dave (Pro):
	Moderator, when the question is extracting and transforming large volumes of data, Excel isn’t just a spreadsheet — it’s a full-fledged ETL and analytics platform. Excel supports 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns per sheet and, crucially, the 64‑bit application can address virtually all available system RAM, enabling Power Query and Power Pivot (the xVelocity in‑memory engine) to compress and analyze datasets in the millions — often tens of millions of rows in practice. Power Query gives end users a repeatable, GUI-driven ETL pipeline with 200+ native connectors (SQL Server, Oracle, SAP, ODBC, Azure, OData), robust transforms and query folding; Power Pivot plus DAX delivers enterprise-grade calculation performance and measures that Google Sheets’ limited formulas and Apps Script can’t match. Sheets caps you at 10 million cells across a file and suffers performance degradation long before Excel’s data model limits, and Apps Script is single‑threaded and slower for heavy processing. Add mature automation with VBA and Office integration, granular enterprise controls (DLP, sensitivity labels, data residency in Microsoft 365), and seamless Power BI handoff, and you get a toolchain designed for heavy duty data work — faster, more scalable, and compliant — which is why professionals and finance teams rely on Excel for large extractions and complex transformations.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:46:39] Tristan (Con):
	Oh, this is my favorite fight. Excel swaggering in with its Power Query bravado — sure, if you love fighting with desktop installs and emailing files back and forth. But when the question is extracting and transforming large volumes of data simply and effectively, Google Sheets wins on practicality and speed-to-insight.
	
	Think about the real world: analysts don’t want to babysit RAM or merge dozens of workbooks. With Connected Sheets you query BigQuery (petabytes, yes petabytes) directly from a sheet without moving data. That means you can run billion-row aggregations in the cloud and pull back only the summarized results. No local memory battles, no VBA headaches. The Query(), ARRAYFORMULA(), FILTER(), IMPORTRANGE combo and Smart Fill let you prototype transforms lightning-fast. Explore and formula suggestions often get you there without writing a single script.
	
	Collaboration? Real-time multi-user editing, sharing controls, automatic version history — teams iterate together, not in siloed Excel purgatory. And if you need heavier automation, Google Cloud Functions + BigQuery do the heavy lifting; Sheets is the friendly front end. I once watched a scrappy startup replace a week of reconciliations with a Connected Sheets query and a single pivot — saved days, avoided server jockeying.
	
	Powerful, cloud-first, and frictionless. For modern large-scale ETL that needs to be simple and collaborative, Google Sheets is the smarter choice.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:47:03] Dave (Pro):
	Nice pitch, Tristan, but charm doesn’t replace facts. Yes, Connected Sheets lets you point at BigQuery — but that’s a cloud dependency with variable costs, egress charges and a provisioning/permission overhead that small teams or regulated enterprises can’t always accept. Google’s “query the lake” approach hides cost and governance issues; Excel’s Power Query + Power Pivot brings repeatable ETL, a 200+ connector ecosystem and a proven in‑memory engine (xVelocity) that compresses data often 10–100x so you can work with tens of millions of rows on a 64‑bit machine while keeping control locally. Excel sheets themselves support 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns; Google limits you to 10 million cells total and performance degrades well before that in practice.
	
	Automation isn’t theoretical — VBA, Office Scripts and full COM/.NET integration let you orchestrate enterprise workflows without brittle cloud quotas. Apps Script is single‑threaded and subject to execution and quota limits; BigQuery queries incur cost per byte processed. For finance, auditability and complex measures, DAX and Power Pivot deliver deterministic, testable calculations that Sheets’ formulas struggle to replicate. Finally, Microsoft 365 provides mature DLP, sensitivity labels, residency controls and seamless Power BI handoff — the compliance backbone large organizations need.
	
	In short: Sheets is great for lightweight, cloud‑native collaboration. For heavy extraction, complex transforms, predictable costs and enterprise governance, Excel is the professional’s tool.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:47:20] Tristan (Con):
	Nice flex, Dave — but flexing specs isn’t the same as solving real problems. You keep pointing at desktop horsepower like it’s a magic wand; the real win is avoiding the battle with hardware, file sprawl, and version hell. Connected Sheets doesn’t “hide” costs so much as let you run billion‑row aggregates where they belong — in BigQuery — and return just the summarized bits to the sheet. That means no RAM wars, no stitching dozens of workbooks, no emailing stale copies at 2 a.m.
	
	Yes, cloud compute can cost money, but compare that to constantly upgrading workstations, managing Power Pivot models across users, or paying consultants to untangle broken VBA. Google Workspace isn’t a governance paperweight: DLP, audit logs, data regions, VPC Service Controls and Cloud IAM let enterprises lock this down without onboarding a SAN admin. Automation isn’t crippled either — Apps Script, Cloud Functions, scheduled BigQuery jobs and REST integrations are the modern, scalable pipeline. You get single source of truth, real‑time editing, and version history that actually saves sanity.
	
	I once watched a tiny finance team replace a tangle of Excel files and a week of reconciliations with a single Connected Sheets query and a pivot — reclaimed five workdays and zero Excel merge nightmares. That’s the point: Sheets trades raw desktop muscle for cloud scale, collaboration, and far less friction. For modern teams who need speed, scale, and teamwork, that’s not a compromise — it’s smarter engineering.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:48:10] User (Moderator):
	Time to switch up the question... Why should a company choose your spreadsheeting software over the other?
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:48:22] Dave (Pro):
	Choose Excel because it’s built for professional, heavy‑duty work where performance, control and compliance matter. Excel supports 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns per sheet and, when run as a 64‑bit app, can use system RAM so Power Query and Power Pivot (xVelocity) compress and analyze tens of millions of rows locally — something Google Sheets’ 10‑million‑cell cap and single‑threaded Apps Script struggle with. Power Query offers a GUI ETL with 200+ connectors and query folding; Power Pivot plus DAX delivers repeatable, testable measures used across finance and analytics teams. Automation options span VBA, Office Scripts and full COM/.NET integration for enterprise workflows, avoiding brittle cloud quotas and single‑thread limits. For governance, Microsoft 365 provides mature DLP, sensitivity labels, conditional access and data residency controls enterprises require. Integration with Power BI and Azure gives a clear, auditable pipeline from raw data to dashboards. Yes, cloud‑native tools can scale, but they introduce variable compute/egress costs and permission overhead that many companies cannot accept. Excel’s predictable local performance, industry ubiquity in finance and accounting, rich extensibility and enterprise security make it the professional choice when you need accuracy, speed and control rather than simpler, lightweight collaboration. In short: when data volume, compliance and complex calculations matter, Excel is the pragmatic, proven option.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:48:32] Tristan (Con):
	Moderator — picture a scrappy analytics team at 2 a.m., buried under a dozen bloated Excel files, praying a merge won’t corrupt the quarter. That was them — until they flipped the switch to Google Sheets and Connected Sheets. Suddenly they were pointing at BigQuery, running billion‑row aggregations in the cloud, and pulling back only the summaries they needed. Reconciliations that used to take a week were done in hours, and collaboration went from frantic email chains to everyone editing the same live view.
	
	This is the heart of my case: for large extractions and straightforward transforms, Sheets is the friendlier, faster path. Connected Sheets lets you query petabyte‑scale datasets where they live, avoiding desktop memory limits and model juggling. Built‑in functions like QUERY, ARRAYFORMULA and FILTER accelerate prototyping without scripting; Smart Fill and Explore shave hours off data prep. Real‑time multiuser editing, automatic version history, and granular sharing mean teams iterate together, not merge in the dark. When you need heavier lifting, BigQuery + Cloud Functions handle it — Sheets becomes the light, collaborative front end, not the bottleneck.
	
	Excel flexes raw desktop power; Google Sheets embraces cloud scale, low friction, and teamwork. For modern, fast, collaborative ETL that keeps complexity in the cloud and insight in people’s hands, Sheets wins.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:48:51] Dave (Pro):
	Nice case from Tristan, but let’s be blunt: convenience isn’t the same as control, and cloud convenience carries hidden trade‑offs. Connected Sheets sounds elegant until you factor in mandatory cloud dependencies, BigQuery provisioning, query costs and potential egress fees — all variable line items that can balloon for frequent, large queries. Many organizations cannot accept unpredictable charges or move regulated data to third‑party clouds; Excel runs locally (or on-premises via Azure) and keeps compute and costs predictable.
	
	Performance isn’t anecdote; it’s measurable. Excel’s 64‑bit app plus Power Query and Power Pivot (xVelocity) lets analysts compress and process tens of millions of rows in memory, with DAX delivering repeatable, testable measures. Google Sheets is capped at ~10 million cells and relies on single‑threaded Apps Script with execution and quota limits — not a recipe for enterprise ETL. Governance matters: Microsoft 365 offers mature DLP, sensitivity labels, conditional access and data residency controls that enterprises rely on; Google’s controls are solid but force different architecture choices and extra admin overhead.
	
	Collaboration? Excel supports cloud co‑authoring and version history while still offering offline work and deterministic calculations auditors can trace. For finance, accounting, and large‑scale, auditable transformation pipelines, Excel is the pragmatic, controllable choice — not just flashy, but fit for purpose.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:05] Tristan (Con):
	Dave, love the spreadsheet flex, but you’re selling nostalgia as stability. Predictable cost? Tell that to the company that keeps buying faster workstations, paying consultants to untangle broken Power Pivot models, and losing days reconciling emailed copies. Cloud predictability is real: BigQuery has flat‑rate commitments, cost control tools, and query caps — you don’t have to pay per query if you plan sensibly. And yes, you can schedule and version SQL, store it in Git, and get auditable, testable pipelines without stuffing everything into a fragile workbook.
	
	Security and compliance aren’t “Windows-only” trophies either. Google Cloud offers CMEK, data regioning, VPC Service Controls, DLP, extensive audit logs and certifications (SOC, ISO, HIPAA, FedRAMP) — all usable without turning analysts into SAN admins. Apps Script limits? Fine — offload heavy tasks to Cloud Functions or scheduled BigQuery jobs; Sheets becomes the interactive surface, not the compute engine. 
	
	You tout DAX as the only “deterministic” option; cool — but complexity breeds errors. Simpler formulas, Connected Sheets’ BigQuery power, and real‑time co‑authoring cut down manual merges, version hell, and the “who edited this” nightmares that actually cost businesses time and money. I once watched a lean team replace a week of Excel wrangling with a single Connected Sheets query and a pivot. That’s not convenience — that’s better engineering.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:19] Dave (Pro):
	Tristan makes a persuasive case for cloud convenience, but convenience doesn’t neutralize the hard constraints enterprises face. Excel’s sheet limit is 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns versus Google Sheets’ ~10 million‑cell cap; run a realistic, repeatable model on a 64‑bit Excel and Power Query/Power Pivot (xVelocity) will compress data often 10–100x and let you work with tens of millions of rows in memory. Power Query offers 200+ connectors and query‑folding; Power Pivot+DAX gives testable, auditable measures finance teams depend on. Apps Script is single‑threaded with execution and quota limits; heavy automation in Google’s stack typically pushes you into BigQuery/Cloud Functions, which introduces provisioning, egress fees and per‑byte processing costs — predictable for some, unacceptable for others.
	
	On governance, Microsoft 365 brings mature DLP, sensitivity labels, conditional access and data residency controls out of the box; many regulated orgs require that level of control. Excel supports cloud co‑authoring and full offline work so audits and deterministic calculations remain reproducible even without constant internet access. For organizations that need scalable local performance, deterministic calculations, predictable costs and enterprise compliance, Excel isn’t nostalgia — it’s the professional, defensible choice.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:31] Tristan (Con):
	Dave, I love the spreadsheet flex—but let’s be honest: waving specs and desktop war stories doesn’t solve the real problems teams face every Monday morning. You brag about RAM and DAX like they’re virtues in themselves; they’re just tools that create brittle, single‑person silos. Google’s approach is to put heavy lifting where it belongs — the cloud. Connected Sheets lets analysts run billion‑row aggregations in BigQuery, return only summaries, and avoid the endless hardware upgrades and file-merging nightmares you’re romanticizing.
	
	Worried about costs? BigQuery has flat‑rate slots, cost controls, partitions, and materialized views — you budget it, you control it. Auditable pipelines? Put SQL in Git, run automated tests and scheduled jobs — reproducible, versioned, and enterprise‑grade. Security? CMEK, VPC Service Controls, DLP, and FedRAMP certifications aren’t “lesser”; they’re robust tools admins already use.
	
	Apps Script isn’t meant to be a supercomputer — it’s the glue for user workflows. When you need scale, you offload to Cloud Functions or scheduled BigQuery jobs. And collaboration? Real‑time co‑editing and version history prevent the “who’s got the latest file” crisis that costs actual money and morale.
	
	I’ve seen tiny teams slash reconciliation time from days to hours by moving transforms into BigQuery and using Sheets as the live, shared surface. That’s not nostalgia-free convenience — that’s smarter engineering.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:36] User (Moderator):
	Thank you both for your participation in this debate. Now, please give your closing statements.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:47] Dave (Pro):
	In closing, choose Excel when you need a professional, auditable, high‑performance workhorse rather than a lightweight collaborative surface. Excel supports 1,048,576 rows by 16,384 columns per sheet and, as a 64‑bit app, can leverage system RAM so Power Query and Power Pivot (xVelocity) compress and process tens of millions of rows—xVelocity routinely delivers 10–100× compression. Power Query’s 200+ connectors plus query folding create repeatable GUI ETL; Power Pivot and DAX deliver deterministic, testable measures finance and audit teams require. Automation options (VBA, Office Scripts, COM/.NET) and native Power BI integration let you build enterprise pipelines without hidden per‑query fees or cloud egress surprises. Microsoft 365’s mature DLP, sensitivity labels, conditional access and data residency controls meet regulated environments’ needs. Google Sheets has great collaboration and cloud scale, but it’s capped at roughly 10 million cells, relies on single‑threaded Apps Script and often forces heavy work into billable cloud services. If accuracy, predictable performance, compliance and complex calculations matter to your business, Excel is the defensible, professional choice.
----------------------------------------

[2025-09-11 11:49:59] Tristan (Con):
	Alright—let me be blunt: spreadsheets are supposed to save time, not spawn a weekend of merges, RAM upgrades, and frantic “who has the latest file?” emails. I’ve seen teams caught in that Excel treadmill—one person becomes the keeper of truth, others fear touching a cell, and weeks of human-hours evaporate fixing mistakes that never should have happened.
	
	Google Sheets flips that script. It moves heavy lifting to the cloud where it belongs, so analysts run billion‑row aggregations in BigQuery and bring back only what’s needed. Teams edit together in real time, version history actually protects you, and the learning curve to prototype is tiny. Yes, enterprise governance and cost control matter — they exist in Google Cloud with CMEK, VPC controls, flat‑rate options and solid auditing. And when you need automation, you compose scalable, testable pipelines — not brittle workbook hacks.
	
	I’m not romanticizing simplicity; I’m arguing for smarter engineering. For speed, collaboration, resilience, and less firefighting at 2 a.m., Sheets gives modern teams a way to do more with less headache. If you want a future where data empowers teams instead of owning them, that’s where I’d put my bet.
